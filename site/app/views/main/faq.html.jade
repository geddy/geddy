        ### Which templating engines does Nails support?
        + EJS
        + Jade
        + Handlebars
        + Mustache

        ### Which databases does Nails's model layer have adapters for?
        + MongoDB
        + Postgres
        + Riak
        + in-memory

        ### Which database adapter does Nails's model layer default to?
        Nails defaults to using the in-memory adapter for newly generated apps, but it's easy to change if you'd like.

        ### Do I have to use the same database adapter for all of my models?
        Nope! Nails was built with data versatility in mind. Each of your models can define it's own adapter, or it can fall back to your globally set adapter.

        ### How does Nails scale across multiple processes?
        Nails uses Node's built in cluster module to create worker processes. This is configurable on an environment to environment basis.

        ### Does Nails support resourceful routes?
        Yep! Just use the router's built in '[resource](/documentation#router.resource)' method and it will build out a full restful API for your resource.

        ### Can Nails generate an app structure for me?
        Yes it can, just use the '[nails app](/documentation#CLIapp)' command.

        ### Can it scaffold resources for me too?
        Yep - the '[nails scaffold](/documentation#CLIscaffold)' command is the one you're looking for.

        ### Your copyright year is in the future.
        That's not a question.

        ### Where does Nails's name come from?
        [Nails Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nails_Lee) is the bass player and singer for the band [Rush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_%28band%29).
